Tools and Features
==================

Before selecting operations in CAM and producing GCODE, tooling and features in the desired part must be accounted for. There are several cases in which this is important:

* Time to complete an operation
* Accuracy of feature
* Depths of pockets, chamfers, minimum interior corner radius, etc.
